##Devon Burson Project Proposal

The Oregon State University High Altitude Liquid Engine (HALE) team is competing in the Base 11 Space Challenge with a goal to be the first student-led university team to design, build, and launch a liquid-propelled, single-stage rocket to an altitude of 100 kilometers (the Karman Line). My masters research project is to design, build, and test the Oregon State University liquid rocket engine testing platform. 

For this course, I will create software used to control and the operation the liquid rocket engine at OSU’s Propulsion Laboratory. The software will include modules to read data from sensors, as well as modules to interpret those signals and respond accordingly. The systems performance will be proven with an extensive testing suite to ensure system reliability

The second goal of this project is to create a HALE repo dedicated to recording the methods used to design OSU’s liquid rocket engine. To do this, the project structure will be created with the purpose of logging each sub-project’s progress throughout the design process. A variety of previous work will be uploaded to populate and demonstrate the format of the project repo.

Future work for this project includes, creating and converting previous analysis tools to python.
